## Computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns:

- Data types, components, hooks and custom hooks are not imported
- Using undeclared variables, declared variables are not used and variable naming is confusing for people who are first coming into read the source code
- Use type any while knowing the exact data type
- Types and functions should be separated into a separate file because they can be reused
